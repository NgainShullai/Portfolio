## About
Hi, I'm Ngain! I graduated with a B. Sc... and have never stopped learning, earning many certificates and gaining diverse experiences. My journey includes many successful businesses. Others taught me valuable lessons through failure. I have an intense enthusiasm for entrepreneurship, reading, and technology. This passion drives me to explore new opportunities. It drives me to explore new ideas in the transformative power of education. Embracing both successes and failures, I strive to view each experience as a blessing. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analysis as an entry-level data analyst. 
During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data visualization, data cleaning and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.
In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
